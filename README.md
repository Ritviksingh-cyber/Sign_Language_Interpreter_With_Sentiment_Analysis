# Sign_Language_Interpreter_With_Sentiment_Analysis
A program wholly trained on the acquired and collected dataset. Which can easily bifurcate between various ISL symbols and can detect the exact emotion of the user for better understanding of conversation.


# Natural Language Processing. 
• Built a Sign language interpreter on both ISL and ASL. 
• Part of the Major Project. 
• For Publication in International conference Chandigarh, College. 
• Scored an accuracy of 95%. 
• Involved Data Cleaning and Data Pre-Processing. 
• Various Machine Learning Algorithms were tried to get the best score using the best models, it included: 
 
- KNN (K Nearest neighbour) 
- SVM (Support Vector Machine) 
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)Natural Language Processing. • Built a Sign language interpreter on both ISL and ASL. • Part of the Major Project. • For Publication in International conference Chandigarh, College. • Scored an accuracy of 95%. • Involved Data Cleaning and Data Pre-Processing. • Various Machine Learning Algorithms were tried to get the best score using the best models, it included: - KNN (K Nearest neighbour) - SVM (Support Vector Machine) - CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
